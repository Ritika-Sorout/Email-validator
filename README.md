Email Validator

This is a simple JavaScript script that utilizes the EmailValidation.io API to validate email addresses. Upon entering an email address in the input field and clicking submit, the script sends a request to the API and displays the validation results.

How to Use
Clone the repository or download the script file.
Include the script in your HTML file.
Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" in the script with your actual API key from EmailValidation.io.
Ensure you have a form with an input field for the email address and a submit button.
Add an empty <div> element with the id resultCont where you want the validation results to appear.
Run your HTML file in a browser.

Note
Ensure your EmailValidation.io API key is kept secure. Avoid exposing it in publicly accessible repositories.
This script provides basic validation results. Customize it as per your requirements or integrate additional functionality as needed.
